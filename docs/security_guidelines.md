## **Introduction**

This document outlines the security guidelines and best practices for developing, deploying, and maintaining the Marvin Agent System. Adhering to these guidelines ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data.

---

## **Access Control**

### **Authentication**

- **Use Strong Authentication Mechanisms**:
  - Implement OAuth 2.0 and JWT for user authentication.
  - Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.
- **Password Policies**:
  - Minimum length of 12 characters.
  - Enforce complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters).
  - Implement account lockout after 5 failed attempts.

### **Authorization**

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Define roles and permissions explicitly.
  - Use least privilege principle for assigning permissions.
- **Session Management**:
  - Implement secure session handling with timeouts and token invalidation.
  - Protect against session fixation and hijacking attacks.

---

## **Data Protection**

### **Encryption**

- **Data at Rest**:
  - Use AES-256 encryption for sensitive data stored in databases.
  - Encrypt backups and snapshots.
- **Data in Transit**:
  - Enforce HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher.
  - Use secure protocols for internal communication (e.g., AMQP over SSL/TLS).

### **Data Storage**

- **Sensitive Data Handling**:
  - Avoid storing sensitive data unless necessary.
  - Use hashed and salted passwords with bcrypt.
- **Data Retention Policies**:
  - Define and implement data retention and deletion policies.

### **Data Transmission**

- **Secure APIs**:
  - Validate API inputs and outputs.
  - Implement rate limiting and throttling.
- **Transport Layer Security**:
  - Regularly update SSL/TLS certificates.
  - Disable insecure protocols and ciphers.

---

## **Input Validation**

- **Sanitize Inputs**:
  - Use server-side validation for all inputs.
  - Implement whitelist validation where possible.
- **Prevent Injection Attacks**:
  - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
  - Sanitize inputs to prevent XSS and command injection.

---

## **Secure Coding Practices**

- **Code Reviews**:
  - Perform peer reviews focusing on security aspects.
- **Use Safe Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - Stay updated with the latest security patches.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Do not expose sensitive information in error messages.
  - Log errors securely without revealing stack traces to users.

---

## **Vulnerability Management**

### **Regular Updates**

- **Patch Management**:
  - Apply security patches promptly.
  - Automate updates where feasible.

### **Dependency Management**

- **Use Trusted Sources**:
  - Verify packages and dependencies.
- **Dependency Scanning**:
  - Use tools like Snyk or Dependabot to detect vulnerabilities.

### **Security Testing**

- **Static Code Analysis**:
  - Integrate tools like SonarQube into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Dynamic Analysis**:
  - Conduct regular penetration testing.
- **Third-Party Audits**:
  - Engage external security experts for audits.

---

## **Logging and Monitoring**

- **Audit Trails**:
  - Log authentication attempts, data access, and administrative actions.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**:
  - Use SIEM tools to detect and alert on suspicious activities.
- **Log Retention**:
  - Store logs securely with restricted access.

---

## **Incident Response Plan**

- **Preparation**:
  - Define roles and responsibilities.
- **Detection and Analysis**:
  - Establish procedures for identifying security incidents.
- **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**:
  - Outline steps to contain and eliminate threats.
- **Post-Incident Activities**:
  - Conduct root cause analysis and update policies.

---

## **Compliance Standards**

- **GDPR**:
  - Ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
- **PCI DSS**:
  - If handling payment information, adhere to PCI DSS standards.
- **ISO/IEC 27001**:
  - Implement an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

---

## **Security Training**

- **Employee Awareness**:
  - Conduct regular security training sessions.
- **Developer Training**:
  - Provide resources on secure coding practices.
- **Policy Updates**:
  - Keep all personnel informed about changes in security policies.
